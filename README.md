# Employee Tracker

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a Command-Line CMS that:
- uses a database schema that contains 3 tables: employee, role, and department
- must be able to add, view, and update departments, roles, and employees
- must use MySQL queries
- uses InquirerJs to collect user input from the command line

[See the video demo of the app's functionality](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eu4rz5xbCGBqI0baiiVGQpyGkj0ZPi-x/view?usp=sharing)

## Skills & Tools Used

- JavaScript
- NodeJs
- MySQL
- Sequelize
- InquirerJs
- ExpressJs

## Challenges

This assignment did not require us to use Sequelize, but I chose to challenge myself to get a better understanding of the tool. My biggest challenge was disecting the way Sequelize returns queries so I could use the data I requested. There is a lot of array-building in this assignment due to this. 

The second biggest challenge was understanding sql joins to pull the specific data I wanted to show/manipulate. I took about an hour and went through the first part of the SQLBolt learning path to get a better understanding of joins before I jumped into the project.

Lastly, I know my code could be cleaner. I'd like to challenge myself to revist this code, separate it into different js files and reduce duplicate code. 

## Future Development

The next step for a project like this would be to give it a front-end and make it deployable on the web.
